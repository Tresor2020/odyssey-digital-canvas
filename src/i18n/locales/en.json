      "paragraph2": "Although we witness the magical encounter of man and water source, however, success wasn't the final destination. An adventure that turns out not only to be an awakening journey that took me, my family, and the whole community into the tunnel voyage of fear, sorrow, nostalgia from the past, world political glimpses, organized religion, the sacred African spirituality, and now the spiritual crisis in Africa, the illusion of existing enemies, witnessing angels in the sky and evil-doers dancing then facing a mirror of witchcraft and realized that death was the only way toward awakening.",
      "paragraph3": "A journey of inner and outer surrender which reveals the natural secret of self-healing methods, which we all have abilities to access and manifest. A concord adventure that was the echoes of African ancestors. A journey beyond the shadow of doubt and the encounter of man and water throughout the rise up of the shining sun."
